coaching_writer_pipeline.py
---------------------------

This module defines the OpenWebUI pipeline for the **CoSMIC Coaching Writer**.
Pipelines act as connectors between user input (chat messages, uploaded files)
and the backend service (`/coach/query`) that performs retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and coaching.

Key responsibilities:
- Detect conversational vs. task-based queries.
- Enforce safety rules (no rewriting or text generation for the user).
- Manage per-user query limits.
- Forward requests to the coaching backend with the appropriate payload.
